<h2>How to Make Panner Butter Masala:</h2>
<div>
    <p>Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.
        While the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients. It’s time for chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, and slicing paneer into cubes.
        To make the ginger garlic paste, crush a 1 inch piece of peeled ginger with 3 to 4 small to medium-sized garlic cloves in a mortar & pestle. Continue crushing until it is a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside.
        After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews to a blender or mixer-grinder.
        Also, add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh water (or as much as is required to blend to a fine paste).
        Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews. Remove the cashew paste from the blender and set it aside.
        In the same blender, add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes.
        Sauté until the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears, about 10 to 12 seconds.
        Begin to cook the tomato purée on a low to medium-low heat. Stir at intervals.
